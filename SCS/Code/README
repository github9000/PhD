SCS-C is a C-language translation and extension of the original
Pascal SCS code presented in Goldberg's text (Goldberg, 1989). 
It has some additional features, but its operation is 
essentially the same as that of the original, Pascal version. 
A technical report (in PostScript file scs-c.ps) 
is included as a concise introduction 
to the SCS-C distribution. It is presented with the assumptions that 
the reader has a general understanding of Goldberg's original Pascal SCS 
code, and a good working knowledge of the C programming language.
The report begins with an outline of the files included in the SCS-C
distribution, and the routines they contain. 
The outline is followed by a discussion of significant features of SCS-C
that differ from those of the Pascal version.


The author is interested in the comments, criticisms, and bug reports
from SCS-C users, so that the code can be refined for easier use in 
subsequent versions. Please email your comments to
