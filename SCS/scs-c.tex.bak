\section{Introduction}

  SCS-C\footnote{{\bf Disclaimer:} SCS-C is distributed
under the terms described in the file
\verb!NOWARRANTY!. These terms are taken from the GNU
Public License. This means that SCS-C has no warranty
implied or given, and that the authors assume no
liability for damage resulting from its use or misuse.}
is a pure ANSI C-language translation of the original Pascal 
SCS code presented by Goldberg\cite{1}. It is a direct
translation and contains no enhancements as such, it's
operation is essentially the same as that of the
original, Pascal version. The report is included as a
concise introduction to the SCS-C distribution. It is
presented with the assumptions that the reader has a
general understanding of Goldberg's original Pascal
code, and a good working knowledge of the C
programming language. The report begins with an outline
of the files included in the SCS-C distribution,
followed by a discussion of the points of SCS-C where
it differs from those of the Pascal version.

\section{Implementation Features of SCS-C}

\subsection{Translation Issues and Memory Utilization}

  Several differences between the Pascal and ANSI-C
programming languages forced a number of minor changes in the
way SCS-C operates in comparison to the original SCS program.
Firstly, in SCS-C all arrays are 1 element larger than their
SCS originals. This is because in C all arrays are indexed
from 0 rather than 1. Loop bounds were left unchanged to avoid
the risk of introducing errors into the C implementation (due
to time constraints).

  Secondly, parameter passing in Pascal is achieved by
reference rather than by value as in C. Consequently, it
seemed easiest to make the variables in SCS-C dynamic and to
pass parameters to/from functions so as to achieve
call-by-reference parameter passing. This introduction of
dynamic variables will allow easier extension of SCS-C in
future experimentation since variables, such as population
sizes, can be more easily varied. 

  The introduction of dynamic variables also has the effect of
moving responsibility for memory management onto the
programmer. This can be controlled via the use of the {\tt
safe\_malloc()}  function (defined in {\tt initial.c}) and 
the {\it free} function (used in {\tt scs.c}).


\subsection{Input / Output}

  Most of the input {\it readln()} statements in Pascal were
translated into equivalent {\it scanf()} calls in SCS-C.
Program termination in the original SCS version however is
achieved in the {\tt halt()} function (defined in {\tt
utility.c}) via the use of Pascal {\tt kbhit()} function.
Since no equivalent function exists in ANSI-C the solution
implemented in SCS-C is to initially prompt the user to enter
a number of generations the genetic algorithm is to run for
and then simply query the user whether they wish the run to
continue or terminate. This leads to the following input
screen (see Fig.\ref{input}).

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}
        prompt% ./scs
        How many generations ? : 2000

        |------------------------|
             Iteration = 50
             P correct = 0.960000
           P50 correct = 0.960000
        |------------------------|
 
 
 
        |------------------------|
             Iteration = 100
             P correct = 0.980000
           P50 correct = 1.000000
        |------------------------|


            . . . . . . . . . .

             Iteration = 2000
             P correct = 0.999000
           P50 correct = 1.000000
        |------------------------|
        Halt (y/n) ? >> y



\end{verbatim}

  Output from SCS-C is essentially identical to that of the
original SCS implementation. Two files ({\tt plot.out} and
{\tt rep.out}) are produced, sample outputs as in Figs.
(\ref{parameters1}, \ref{parameters2}, \ref{gens0}, \ref{gens2000}).

\section{Final Comments}

  SCS-C is intended to be a simple program for first
time classifier system experimentation. It is not
intended to be definitive in terms of its efficiency
or the grace of its implementation. The
authors are interested in the comments, criticisms, and bug
reports
from SCS-C users, so that the code can be refined for
easier use in subsequent versions.
